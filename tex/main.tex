\section{Background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{jackson60} (1960): Nonpreemptive M/M/1 where customers are served in order of the difference between their waiting time and urgency number (that is priorities increasing linearly over time). Solved by considering event probabilities at clock ticks.
  \item \cite{holtzman71} (1971): Similar to the above, but treat each urgency number as a separate customer class, and not considering clock ticks. Upper and lower bounds on the waiting times, based on FIFO and static priorities.
  \item \cite{netterman79} (1979): Now considers the case where priorities increase non-linearly but concavely over time.
  \item \cite{fratini90} (1990): Nonpreemptive M/G/1 queue with two classes of customers, where priorities switch if the number from one class exceeds a given threshold. Lower priority customers have a finite waiting capacity, higher have infinite capacity.
  \item \cite{knessl03} (2003): Similar to the above but with Markovian services and infinite waiting capacities for both customers.
  \item \cite{xie08} (2008): Preemptive n-priority-classes M/M/c with exponential upgrades. Customers only upgrade to the priority immediately higher than themselves. Stability considered.
  \item \cite{down10} (2010): Preemptive two-priority-classes M/M/c with exponential upgrades. Customers cannot upgrade if the number of lower priority customers is below a given threshold. Holding costs considered.
  \item \cite{he12} (2012): Extention of the above, allows batch arrivals, multiple classes, phase-type upgrades and services. Customers only upgrade to the priority immediately higher than themselves.
  \item \cite{bilodeau22} (2022): Analytical (truncated) expressions for a two class delayed accumulating priority M/G/1 queue. Customer priorities increase linearly over time, at different rates according to class, after an initial fixed delay.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{At the moment I don't see any consideration of customers downgrading, or 'skipping' classes, i.e. transfering to a priority class not immediately higher than themselves.}

\section{The Model}
Here we consider an $M/M/c$ queue with $K$ classes of customer.
Order and label the customer classes $0, 1, 2, \dots, K-1$, with customer
classes with lower labels having priority over customer classes of higher
labels. The index $k$ will be used to represent customer classes.
Let:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\lambda_k$ be the arrival rate of customers of class $k$,
  \item $\mu_k$ be the service rate of customers of class $k$,
  \item $\theta_{k_i,k_j}$ be the rate at which customers of class $k_i$ change
  to customers of class $k_j$.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:twoclass_example} shows an example with two classes of customer.

\section{State Markov Chain Formulation}
Let
$\underline{\mathbf{s}}_t = (s_{0,t}, s_{1,t}, \dots, s_{K-1,t}) \in \mathbb{N}^K$
represent the state of the system at time step $t$, where $s_{k,t}$ represents
the number of customers of class $k$ present at time step $t$.

Then the rates of change between $\underline{\mathbf{s}}_t$ and
$\underline{\mathbf{s}}_{t+1}$ are given by Equation~\ref{eqn:transitions},
where $\underline{\mathbf{\delta}} = \underline{\mathbf{s}}_t - \underline{\mathbf{s}}_{t+1}$,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:transitions}
q_{\underline{\mathbf{s}}_t, \underline{\mathbf{s}}_{t+1}} = 
\begin{cases}
\lambda_k & \text{if } \delta_k = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k \\
B_{k,t} \mu_k & \text{if } \delta_k = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k \text{ and } \sum_{i < k} s_{i,t} < c \\
(s_{k,t} - B_{k,t}) \theta_{k_0,k_1} & \text{if } \delta_{k_0} = -1 \text{ and } \delta_{k_1} = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k_0, k_1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

and $B_{k,t}$, representing the number of customers of class $k$ currently in
service at time step $t$, is given by Equation~\ref{eqn:inservice}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inservice}
B_{k,t} =\min\left(c - \min\left(\sum_{i < k} s_{i,t}, c\right), s_{k,t}\right)
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{TODO (?) Unroll the matrix to get a (double?) infinite sum for state probabilities. If possible this would make calculations much more efficient by truncating an infinite sum rather than an infinite matrix.}


\section{Sojourn Time Markov Chain Formulation}
Let $\underline{\mathbf{z}}_t = (z_{0,t}, z_{1,t}, \dots, z_{n,t} \dots, z_{K-1,t}, b_t, n_t) \in \mathbb{N}^{K+2}$
represent the state of a particular customer at time step $t$, where $n_t$
represents that customer's class at time $t$; $z_{k,t} \; \forall \; k < n$
represents the number of customers of class $k$ in front of the customer in the
queue at time $t$; $z_{k,t} \; \forall \; n < k < K$ represents the number of
customers of class $k$ behind the customer in the queue at time $t$; and $b_t$
represent the number of customers of class $n_t$ behind the customer in the
queue at time $t$.
Also let $\star$ represent an absorbing state, representing the state where that
customer has finished service and left the system.

Then the rates of change between $\underline{\mathbf{z}}_t$ and
$\underline{\mathbf{z}}_{t+1}$ are given by Equation~\ref{eqn:transitions_sojourn},
where $\underline{\mathbf{\delta}} = \underline{\mathbf{z}}_t - \underline{\mathbf{z}}_{t+1}$,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:transitions_sojourn}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
$q_{\underline{\mathbf{z}}_t, \underline{\mathbf{z}}_{t+1}} = 
\begin{cases}
\mu_n & \text{if } z_{t+1} = \star \text{ and } \sum_{k \leq n} z_{k, t} < c \\
\lambda_n & \text{if } \delta_K = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq K \\
\lambda_k & \text{if } \delta_k = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k \text{ and } k \neq n\\
A_{k,n,t} \mu_k & \text{if } \delta_k = -1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k \text{ and } k < K\\
\tilde{A}_{n,t} \mu_n & \text{if } \delta_K = -1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq K\\
(z_{k_0,t} - A_{k_0,n,t}) \theta_{k_0,k_1} & \text{if } \delta_{k_0} = -1 \text{ and } \delta_{k_1} = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k_0, k_1 \text{ and } k_0 < K \text{ and } k_1 \neq n, K, K+1 \\
(z_{K,t} - \tilde{A}_{n,t}) \theta_{n,k} & \text{if } \delta_K = -1 \text{ and } \delta_{k} = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k, n \text{ and } k < K \\
(z_{k,t} - A_{k,n,t}) \theta_{k,n} & \text{if } \delta_k = -1 \text{ and } \delta_K = 1 \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \; \forall \; i \neq k, K \\
\theta_{n, k} & \text{if } \delta_n = z_{K,t} \text{ and } \delta_K = -z_{K,t} \text{ and } \delta_{K+1} = n - k \text{ and } \delta_i = 0 \text{ otherwise, and } \sum_{k \leq n} z_{k, t} < c \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$%
}
\end{equation}

and $A_{k,n,t}$ and $\tilde{A}_{n, t}$ are given by
Equations~\ref{eqn:inservice_adapt} and~\ref{eqn:inservice_adapt_tilde}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inservice_adapt}
A_{k,n,t} =
\begin{cases}
\min\left(c, \sum_{i \leq k} z_{i,t}\right) - \min\left(c \sum_{i < k} z_{i,t}\right) & \text{if } k \leq n \\
\min\left(c, \sum_{i \leq k} z_{i,t} + 1 + z_{K,t}\right) - \min\left(c \sum_{i < k} z_{i,t} + 1 + z_{K,t}\right) & \text{if } n < k < K
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inservice_adapt_tilde}
\tilde{A}_{n,t} =
\min\left(c, \sum_{i \leq n} z_{i,t} + 1 + z_{K,t}\right) - \min\left(c, \sum_{i \leq n} z_{i,t} + 1\right) \\
\end{equation}


The expected time to absorption can be calculated from each state.
Customers arrive in all states where $z_{K,t} = 0$, and their class can be
determined by $n$. Combining these times to absorption with the state
probabilities found in the previous section, the sojourn times for each customer
class can be found.

\textcolor{red}{TODO (?) Unroll the matrix to get a (double?) infinite sum for state probabilities. If possible this would make calculations much more efficient by truncating an infinite sum rather than an infinite matrix.}
